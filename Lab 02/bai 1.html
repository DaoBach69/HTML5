    <h1>An Insider's Guide to NYFW</h1>
    <p>NYFW can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming, especially if you've
        never been. Luckily, I'm here to give you an insider's guide and make your first
        show a pleasurable experience. By taking my tips and tricks, and following your gut,
        you'll have an unforgettable experience!</p>
    <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows</h2>
    <p>If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn't
        so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I'm here to help you out. First, plan out
        which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie:
        SET A BUDGET. If you're worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you
        won't have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers
        you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited.</p>
    <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>
    <p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll be uncomfortable the
        whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and
        taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. Also
        it's important to wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to
        look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
